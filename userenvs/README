The json files found in this directory can be built with build.sh:

./build.sh $userenv

where $userenv can be any directory name other than "components".

For example:

./build.sh fedora32

Since there is lot of commonality among these user environemts,
parts of their json come from common files under components.
Each user env directory requires a schema.json, a userenv.json,
and a requirements subdirectory with files for requirements.
Any of these files can be symlinks to shared files in the
components subdirectory.  Instaed of hand-editing a $userenv.json,
change or add files in the ./$userenv directory and rerun the
build command.
